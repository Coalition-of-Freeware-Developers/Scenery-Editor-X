# Scenery Editor X 
Scenery Editor X is a editor tool for use in creating, modifying, and building custom X-Plane 12 scenery. Unlike similar editing software this program utilizes a 3D viewport to allow the user to quickly and rapidly manipulate and create sceneries with more adaptive and modern tools and utilities. 

### Features
* Interactive and responsive 3D viewport
* X-Plane Library asset management tools
* Ability to import `.USD`, `.obj`,`.obj8`, `.fbx`, and `.gltf` files and export with the project as a library item converted into the X-Plane `.obj8` format. 
* Ability to create and edit X-Plane specific formats such as; `.lin`,  `.pol`, `.fac`, `.ags`, `.agb`, and `.str` assets.
* Provide visual editor tools for asset creation and manipulation
* Replicate graphics shaders to achieve an accurate representation of the scenery when implemented. 
* Compatible with the X-Plane Scenery Gateway.
* Time of day visualization 
* Plugin system to allow custom tools and features to be implemented to meet the users need. 
* Ability to open and convert WED projects into Scenery Editor X projects.
